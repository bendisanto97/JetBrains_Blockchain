# JetBrains - BlockChain Project
JetBrains Academy Java Developer Project
[BlockChain Project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/50?track=1)

## Description
In this project, you will try yourself at making a microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and exchange messages and transactions using blockchain. As difficult as the project might be, it is bound to pay off: not in cryptocurrency, but in knowledge and skills.

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Features

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
